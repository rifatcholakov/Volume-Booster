# Privacy Policy for Easy Volume Booster

This Privacy Policy describes how Volume Booster ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information.

## Information Collection and Use

Volume Booster does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data, browsing history, or user information.

### tabCapture and Audio Processing
The extension uses the `tabCapture` API to access the audio stream of the active tab for the sole purpose of adjusting its volume. 
- The audio data is processed locally on your machine.
- Audio data is **never** recorded, stored, or sent to any server.
- The extension requires the `<all_urls>` permission to function on any website where you choose to use it, but it only accesses audio on the specific tab you interact with.

## Data Security
All processing happens within your browser's local environment. We do not have access to any of your data.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
